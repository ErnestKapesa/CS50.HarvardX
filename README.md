HarvardX: CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science
=================
This is where I keep all my solutions to CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science). This repo exists to facilitate code review for potential employers verifying my progress with Computer Science. It is in no way a solicitation to cheat Harvard/Yales CS50 course. 

>Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.
